      <p>
        When I first explored student design teams at Iowa State, AIAA Design Build Fly (DBF) immediately stood out for its strong team 
        dynamic and ambitious mission. The challenge of designing an RC aircraft that could meet real-world engineering constraints 
        excited me, and I wanted to be part of it. Although I joined as a new member, I asked to take on a leadership position, and so, I led the Operations team, which was a brand-new subsystem with little structure or guidance. I quickly realized that to be successful in my role 
        I would have to immediately start building organization from the ground up, and getting as much guidance as I possibly can. By asking questions, defining my team members' roles, and establishing a clear workflow, I 
        helped create a smoother dynamic and motivated team that kept the project on schedule and aligned with competition requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout the course of the project, our team worked to design an aircraft capable of taking off within 20 feet and completing three complex 
        missions with a foldable wing design, as required by the AIAA rulebook. The process required constant problem-solving, communication, 
        and adaptability as we designed, manufactured, and tested. At the end, our efforts paid off and we placed 45th out of 100 
        teams, making it the first time an Iowa State DBF team earn competition points. Beyond rankings, the experience connected us with 
        aerospace enthusiasts from around the world and deepened my appreciation for collaborative engineering. It was more than just a competition, it 
        was a lesson in leadership, resilience, and innovation. 
      </p>

      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Led the operations team for Iowa State’s AIAA Design Build Fly project, ensuring all decisions complied with competition rules and met deadlines.</li>
        <li>Coordinated design, manufacturing, and testing schedules, using Gantt charts to track progress and maintain efficient workflow across subsystems.</li>
        <li>Oversaw logistics, purchasing, and budget management, submitting required forms and selecting flight test windows based on weather and team readiness.</li>
        <li>Planned and executed flight tests, assigning roles, developing safety checklists, and leading post-flight debriefs to evaluate performance and identify improvements.</li>
        <li>Collaborated on the writing and editing of technical reports.</li>
      </ul>
